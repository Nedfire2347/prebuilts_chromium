## H264 encoder support for Chromium

Support for h264 encoder is not added for legal reasons


### Why using e.g. Chromium?

AOSP Source uses AOSP Browser until Android 6 by default.
AOSP Browser is absoloutly not up to date and should not be used on any roms these days because of it's security holes.


### There's a great lightweight Browser, can't i use it?

On Android 6+ it is ok to use a lightweight Browser which is using systems Webview implementation (as long as your system still gets security updates). 
If you have access to Rom source and compiling the Rom yourself you can find an updated Chromium-based WebView Implementation below in the ["Information for Developer"](https://github.com/andi34/prebuilts_chromium#updated-chromium-based-webview).

On Android 4 and older you should use a Browser which comes with it's own, updated, Webview.
(Currently there's no good way to update WebView on Android 4.)


## Information for Developer

You can use this repo to add Chromium prebuilt into your Rom. Please read below information.


### How to add Chromium prebuilt into our Rom?

Add Chromium to your build config once you have cloned this repo into your Rom source:

```
# Chromium Browser
PRODUCT_PACKAGES += \
    Chromium

```
(e.g. inside your device.mk)


On most roms you can avoid adding Chromium to your device config.
Most Roms support an easy way to add more packages - you only need to create
```
vendor/extra/product.mk
```
and add call the PRODUCT_PACKAGES from there.

Here's an example of an local_manifest you can use:
```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<manifest>

  <remote  name="andi34"
           fetch="https://github.com/andi34/" />

  <project path="vendor/extra" name="android_vendor_extra" remote="andi34" revision="m" />
  <project path="prebuilts/chromium-browser" name="prebuilts_chromium" remote="andi34" revision="master" />

</manifest>
```

CyanogenMod initial added support for an easy way to add more packages by the following changes:

1. [add a hook to add extra packages](https://github.com/LineageOS/android_vendor_cm/commit/45e6598078e3a919ec644b8ad22bf9ad2912e876)
2. [cm: Update use of vendor/extra](https://github.com/LineageOS/android_vendor_cm/commit/b9dd400b385b18519cad768b5ec45fcbe9973f22)
3. [Allow vendor/cyngn overlays to override vendor/cm overlays](https://github.com/LineageOS/android_vendor_cm/commit/39b9aa83f003aaf9842bc091ef0a4c2d3d2d15e4)

You can adapt those changes to your rom source if it isn't supported yet.


### Let's avoid patching our device tree or rom source to add Chromium prebuilt to our Rom

- For Android 5 and below we are using ChromePublic.apk
- For Android 6 and newer we are using ChromeModernPublic.apk (we use an updated Webview Implementation, see below ["Updated Chromium-based WebView"](https://github.com/andi34/prebuilts_chromium#updated-chromium-based-webview))


### How to use MonochromePublic on Android 7+

To use prebuilt MonochromePublic.apk on Android 7+ you need to add chromium to frameworks/base/core/res/res/xml/config_webview_packages.xml
(Your can also add it to your device overlay).

```

<webviewproviders>
    <!-- The default WebView implementation -->
    <webviewprovider description="Chromium" packageName="org.chromium.chrome" availableByDefault="true">
    </webviewprovider>
</webviewproviders>
```
Once that's done you need to [modify the Android.mk](https://github.com/andi34/prebuilts_chromium/commit/09cd63b824ffa08c2365d276d1540ba45cf3c865#diff-3ae6be565f1e33e90e0b11f768de1f6c) to use MonochromePublic.apk.

Note: You can save some space while using ChromeModernPublic.apk and updating Webview inside your Rom source instead using MonochromePublic.apk, see below ["Updated Chromium-based WebView"](https://github.com/andi34/prebuilts_chromium#updated-chromium-based-webview).


### How to use ChromeModernPublic on Android 5

On Android 5 ChromeModernPublic.apk can't be used as prebuilt without patching your Rom source:

Run these commands:
```
cd build
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andi34/prebuilt_chromium/master/patches/Lollipop/0001-Fix-Chrome.patch | git am -
```
Once that's done you need to modify the Android.mk to use ChromeModernPublic.apk:
```
LOCAL_SRC_FILES    := ChromeModernPublic.apk
LOCAL_PREBUILT_JNI_LIBS_arm := @lib/armeabi-v7a/crazy.libchrome.so
LOCAL_PREBUILT_JNI_LIBS_arm += @lib/armeabi-v7a/libchromium_android_linker.so
```


### Updated Chromium-based WebView

- an updated Chromium-based WebView for Android 6 [can be found here](https://github.com/android-security/android_external_chromium-webview/tree/aosp-6.0)
- an updated Chromium-based WebView for Android 7 [can be found here](https://github.com/android-security/android_external_chromium-webview/tree/aosp-7.1)

You should use the updated WebView if you are compiling your Rom from source.


### Build instructions

You can find the build instructions [here](https://www.chromium.org/developers/how-tos/get-the-code) to Checkout, Build, & Run Chromium for your OS.


### Our build settings

Chromium for Android is compiled using the GN build tool. To match our build settings, set:

```
target_os = "android"
is_debug = false
symbol_level = 0
enable_nacl = false
remove_webcore_debug_symbols = true
```

in your GN argument file before building.


### H264 encoder support for Chromium

Support for h264 encoder is not added for legal reasons. If you like to compile Chromium yourself with h264 encoder support you need to extend your GN argument file with the following:

```
proprietary_codecs = true
ffmpeg_branding = "Chrome"
```


### Multiple Chrome APK Targets according to the official build instructions

1. `chrome_public_apk` (ChromePublic.apk)
   * `minSdkVersion=16` (Jelly Bean).
   * Stores libchrome.so compressed within the APK.
   * Uses [Crazy Linker](https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/base/android/linker/BUILD.gn?rcl=6bb29391a86f2be58c626170156cbfaa2cbc5c91&l=9).
   * Shipped only for Android < 21, but still works fine on Android >= 21.
2. `chrome_modern_public_apk` (ChromeModernPublic.apk)
   * `minSdkVersion=21` (Lollipop).
   * Uses [Crazy Linker](https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/base/android/linker/BUILD.gn?rcl=6bb29391a86f2be58c626170156cbfaa2cbc5c91&l=9).
   * Stores libchrome.so uncompressed within the APK.
     * This APK is bigger, but the installation size is smaller since there is
       no need to extract the .so file.
3. `monochrome_public_apk` (MonochromePublic.apk)
   * `minSdkVersion=24` (Nougat).
   * Contains both WebView and Chrome within the same APK.
     * This APK is even bigger, but much smaller than SystemWebView.apk + ChromePublic.apk.
   * Stores libchrome.so uncompressed within the APK.
   * Does not use Crazy Linker (WebView requires system linker).
     * But system linker supports crazy linker features now anyways.
